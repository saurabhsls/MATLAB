#### Installation
Using the App Installer:
1. Download the .mlappinstall file of the latest release.
2. Run the MATLAB Installer file. The program should unpack itself and install as an app in MATLAB. 
3. Run the installed app "ImageEncryptor" from the "Apps" menu in MATLAB.

Manually (recommended for MATLAB versions before R2018b):
1. Download the source files from the release.
2. Move the content to a location in which you have write permission (to store files). Also, make sure the folder is empty to prevent possible conflicts when running the code.
3. Run the .mlapp file compatible with your MATLAB version to directly run the app.
